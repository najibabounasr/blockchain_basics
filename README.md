# Basic Blockchain Application

This is a basic blockchain application created by `najibabounasr`, an SMC CS student and Fintech enthusiast. This repository is intended to store all basic blockchain-creating applications.

## Introduction

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that stores data across a network of computers. It is secured by cryptographic techniques and provides a secure and transparent way of recording transactions, contracts, and other data.

Hashing is a crucial component of blockchain technology. Hashing is a process of converting input data into a fixed-size output that represents the original data in a unique way. In blockchain, hashing is used to create a unique digital signature for each block in the chain, ensuring that the data stored on the blockchain cannot be tampered with.

Blockchain technology has a significant impact on finance, as it provides a secure and transparent way of recording financial transactions. It eliminates the need for intermediaries, such as banks and financial institutions, and allows for peer-to-peer transactions. This makes it possible to reduce transaction costs, increase efficiency, and improve transparency.
